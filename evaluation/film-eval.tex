\subsection{FiLM}
The results here are following the proposed modulation 6 wrist RGB and depth modulation techniques from Section \ref{subsec:policies-film}. 

Each variant of this policy has some hyperparameters associated with it. After some preliminary testing, for \textbf{LATE} models, with the initial learnt down-sampling and the FiLM module
\begin{itemize}
  \item Initial Downsampling Network, which does $3$ convolutions takes in a \(\langle 3, ~64, ~64 \rangle\) image and returns features of shape \(\langle 16, ~4, ~4 \rangle \)
  \item Then the FiLM module takes in two of these feature vectors and does the modulation. The resulting encoding size is \(16 \times 4 \times 4 = 256\) as FiLM does change the shape of the given tensor.
  \item If there is bi-modulation the final encoding is double the size, $512$, as the modulated vectors are concatenated.
\end{itemize}

For \textbf{NON-LATE} models:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shallow encoder, used to match the channel dimension of modalities, is a single \verb|Conv2d|  that upsamples the channel dimensions to $6$ while preserving width and height ($64 \times 64$), \todo[color=green]{again appendix}.
  \item The FiLM network as before does not change the sizes returns \(\langle 12, ~64, ~64 \rangle \) or \(\langle 6, ~64, ~64 \rangle \) respectively if it is bi-modulation or not.
  \item Finally there is another CNN that encodes these modulated features, see \todo[color=green]{appendix}, which have layers $\left[36, ~72, ~128, ~128\right]$ and $\left[32, ~48, ~64, ~128\right]$ respectively to bi or not. The final feature size is \(\langle 128, ~2, ~2 \rangle\) regardless.
\end{itemize}
