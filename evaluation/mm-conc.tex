\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsubsection{Model Parameter Sizes}
not sure if this stuff is needed what the fuck am i even evaluating
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{|| c | c ||}
  Module name & parameter count \\
  \hline
  grasp\_head & \\ \(128 \times \text{encoding\_size} + 8256\)
  joint position encoder & 8640 \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}\caption{Generic Module Sizes}\label{tab:film-param-counts}
\end{table}


\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{|| c | c | c ||}
  \hline
  
  \hline
  Config & proprioceptive & \\
  separate grasp head & $1\times 10^{-3}$ \\
  \end{tabular}\caption{FiLM model parameters counts}\label{tab:film-param-counts2}
\end{table}

\todo{compare the feats attn param sizes with the param sizes of film networks for wrist, then compare its capability with other sensors should do many other combinations here }

General conclusion is that no one task is not solvable immediately by a single method and there are drawbacks and pros of each. This makes life complicated for the coming active tests, mainly because the active vision policy is not very competent and secondly \todo{not sure here}
