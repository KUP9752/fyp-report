\subsection{Baseline - Naive Modality Concatenation}
This will be the baseline to compare the rest of the data. A hard set hyperparameter is the encoding CNN, for which the code can be found here \todo[color=green]{appendix code}. The layers of which are set to $\left[32, ~48, ~64, ~128\right]$ and the final encoding is of shape \(\langle 128, ~2, ~2 \rangle\).

The `test' counterpart had no successes.
