\section{Naive Colour Attention - Results}
\section{Recurrent Models - Results}
Not much better in terms of numbers however the model size is lower?? not sure experiment with this the big ass 4 way attention is the most expensive currently and this might be a contender,

talk about the shorter training to get comparable results, smoother trajectories learn occlusions robustly (?? i have not observed this i don't think)


This lead to a more robust and confident architecture. The movements of my policy felt less spiky, no more sudden jerks and more calculated reaching. It did still absolutely overfit to the average position, and was not much better at grasping, but the episodic movements were cleaner and I believe enhancing the grasping branch of the network would allow it to be more successful \todo{what the fuck am i talking about, summarise and clean up}
