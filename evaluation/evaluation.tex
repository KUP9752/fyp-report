\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:eval}
Here I will evaluate:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Findings from the FDC investigations
  \item Compare the proposed active vision approaches to non-active systems from before
\end{enumerate}\todo{split later if needed}

\section{Evaluation Limitations}\todo[color=red]{}
The main glaring limitation is the sensor size. To keep the testing and the model sizes manageable I refrained. from using sensors that are too high resolution. However, as discussed earlier, the comparisons are done on the same resolutions keeping the results comparable and there is no
