\chapter{Evaluation}
Here I will evaluate:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Findings from the FDC investigations
  \item Compare the proposed active vision approaches to non-active systems from before
\end{enumerate}\todo{split later if needed}


\section{Evaluation Setup}

\subsection{Vision Random and Grasping}

\subsection{ReachObs Random (maybe also Ind) and occluded reaching}
Although this task is likely to be not the best we can still see what the proposed systems can achieve in this domain

\section{Evaluated Configurations}

\section{Results}
