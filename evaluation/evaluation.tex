\chapter{Evaluation}
Here I will evaluate:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Findings from the FDC investigations
  \item Compare the proposed active vision approaches to non-active systems from before
\end{enumerate}

\section{What do we learn about Vision?}
\todo{conclusions of chapter 5c}

\section{Comparison of Active Approaches}
\todo{comparison of active policies, get these to work, plan2 needs help}

\subsection{Which is better at which tasks? again comparison and final thoughts, maybe evaluate on some other tasks possibly in rlbench but this is extra, might even go in future work}
