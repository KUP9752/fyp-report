\chapter{Camera Combination Investigations}
This chapter I will experiment with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a good vision score policy without intrinsic information about the simulator.
    \item simple colour checking with a threshold?? -> shit but all that I could get working 
    \item  reay projectrion and checking if it lands on target
      \item  prior info about target?? -> using CAD models I can do RBG(-D) pose estimation
      \item extract prior information form demonstration?
  \item segmentation masks to pull bits out
    \item  How do we know which segmentation mask is my target?
  \item 
\end{itemize}


\todo{in the vision experiments section add the condlusion from `plots.ipynb'  talk about why wrist is not generalising and the possible fixes by adding depth, }


\todo{move the depth interfacing here}
