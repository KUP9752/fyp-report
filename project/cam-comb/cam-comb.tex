\chapter{View and Feature Combination Investigations}\label{ch:view-comb}
This chapter I will be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Creating more complicated toy tasks in RLBench
  \item Propose various imitation learning agents to solve these tasks
  \item Evaluate said methods by:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Providing different views and features
    \item Augmenting the fusion of these features
    \item Understand how the agent `views' a scene and what information it benefits from for which tasks
    \item Compare the strengths and weaknesses of these methods
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
