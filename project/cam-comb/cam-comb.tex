\chapter{Camera Combination Investigations}
This chapter I will be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Creating some toy tasks in RLBench
  \item Propse methods of imitiation learning to solve these tasks
  \item Experiment with the strengths and weaknesses of said methods
  \item Augment my proposals with findings
  \item Use learnings to guide proposed active policies in the next chapter \todo{maybe remove this}
  
  \todo{there are commented notes from earlier here, might help the next section}
  % \item a good vision score policy without intrinsic information about the simulator.
  %   \item simple colour checking with a threshold?? -> shit but all that I could get working 
  %   \item  reay projectrion and checking if it lands on target
  %     \item  prior info about target?? -> using CAD models I can do RBG(-D) pose estimation
  %     \item extract prior information form demonstration?
  % \item segmentation masks to pull bits out
  %   \item  How do we know which segmentation mask is my target?
  \item 
\end{itemize}


\todo{in the vision experiments section add the condlusion from `plots.ipynb'  talk about why wrist is not generalising and the possible fixes by adding depth, }


\todo{move the depth interfacing here}
