\section{Third Approach: Separate Cam and Hand Control}
\todo{explain what this is}
Initial idea from my supervisor was to train a policy -using reinforcement learning- to train a policy that directly controls the camera, for any task and object. Then when the main policy is trained using imitation learning on the specific task from the humuan demonstrations, both policies can be deployede to make sure the robot is optimally obsereving areas of the task that might be of interest.

Even though this was the main objective of the project from the get-go, without the previous ground work and the clearer understadning of comparably simpler policies, this would have been very hard to start working on. This is why 

\subsection{Proposed Approach}
\todo{propose some plan, maybe talk about placing a second movable camera in the workspace}


\subsection{Implementation}
Due to its complexity, and frankly, running out of the limited time we are allowed for this project, I was not able to iterate on this approach to the same quality as the ones above, and produce a system that works using this plan.

Hence, this will not be in the final comparison, but being the main motivator of the project, this is what this project will naturally evolve into, if development were to be furthered in this area.

\todo{even if i get a shitty implementation of this, which is not happening i dont think, I will just say not good enough to add to results etc}
