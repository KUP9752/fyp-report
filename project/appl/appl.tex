\chapter{Active Perception Policy Learning}\label{ch:appl}
In this section, by using what I have learnt so far, I will:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Proposing some approaches to implementing active perception policies, mainly:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item 3D Environmental reasoning policy
        \item View Uncertainty score policy
        % \item Human-like separate camera and gripper model for learning
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Discuss implementation details and ideas
  \end{itemize}

Contrary to the previous section, active vision entails moving the primary information source, as the robot control involves moving our robot (and by proxy its gripper) the cameras I will be mostly working with here will include some combination of the wrist mounted sensors, such as the RGB camera and the depth sensor.
