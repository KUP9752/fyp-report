As the project is an evaluation of the proposed framework upon adding active vision elements. It will have to be done on a pre-set collection of robot tasks. 
Firstly, these tasks will be attempted with conventional approaches as control, either pre-trained open-sourced policies in a static-camera setting, or in-house policies without active perception. This will show us whether the improvements we suggest, in the form of extra learning and acting through active vision, has an affect on the success rate of the agents learning to do these tasks.

On top of in-simulation testing, the
