\section{Early Work}
Early steps I was advised to work on was, getting an idea of \emph{learning} in two dimensions (2D) to get an intuition and follow it on with expanding it to three dimensions (3D) from there.

\subsection{PyGame \& Structuring the Problem}
Following those ideas I wanted to create a simple task a

\subsection{Solving the Problem: Learning}

\subsubsection{Classification}
\subsubsection{Regression}

\subsection{Extending the Problem: Vision}
\subsection{Next Hurdle: Obstacles}
\subsubsection{Generation}
some issues after this
\subsubsection{Kernel Receptive Area}
