\chapter{Project Plan}
  In this chapter, I will cover:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What the project entails and how the work will be divided until the end of the project's timeline.
    \item The ultimate evaluation plan for the entire project once the data is collected.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Evaluation Plan}
As the project is an evaluation of the proposed framework upon adding active vision elements. It will have to be done on a pre-set collection of robot tasks. 
Firstly, these tasks will be attempted with conventional approaches as control. This will show us whether the improvements we suggest, in the form of extra active vision learning, has an affect on the success rate of the agents learning to do these tasks.
