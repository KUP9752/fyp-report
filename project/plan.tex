\chapter{Project Plan}
  In this chapter, I will cover:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What the project entails and how the work will be divided until the end of the project's timeline.
    \item The ultimate evaluation plan for the entire project once models are created and data is collected.
  \end{enumerate}
