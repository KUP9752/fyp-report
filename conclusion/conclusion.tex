\chapter{Conclusion}
I will conclude the report here with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Final thoughts
  \item Declarations
  \item Future work
\end{itemize}

\section{Concluding Remarks}
how active vision is a remerging area of study, however, an area with a steep learning curve and important priors not unlike its usual priors provided 


Chapter 3 I learnt about using CoppeliaSim and 3D simulators, novel for me and quite a challenge ...


In chapter 4 explored various tasks, though simple, to test the understanding capability of a robot given minimal views and data (with minimlal resolution) conclusions, I proposed potential feature alignment mostly for personal understanding and furthering the 

In chapter 5, using my learnings so far, I proposed some active policies and explored their feasability as well as theri performance




\section{Declarations}
  \subsection{Sustainability and Ethical Considerations}i
  \todo{talk about machine learning and powerdraw for datacentres in consumiong insurmountable amounts of energy for training, any machine learning research although intellectually interesting might contribute to the rise of AI, talk about this and how it is tangential but important to acknowledge}

  \subsection{Use of Generative AI}
  Generative AI is an important tool in modern times and can be quite a time-saver if used correctly. 
  I declare that I have used Generative AI tools in this project in line with Imperial College's guidance and principles. Generative AI has not in any way been involved in the intellectual material produced in this project such as the report or the code. However, it was used in areas such as:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Creating appealing and clear plots using \verb|matplotlib| and \verb|seaborn| \todo{ref these?} using data I have collected.
    \item Formatting the bibliography and helping generate BiBTeX style bibliographies where it wasn't specifically provided by an author.
    \item Quick initial searches to help find some pivotal papers and kickstart my individual research into a topic.
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Project Materials}
  The materials on this project are available here:
  \todo[color=red]{Update the readme of the repo to explain things}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Codebase: \todo{insert link to public repo}
    \item Report: \todo{insert link to public repo}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
\todo{talk about the final active vision policy and whatnot, keep it fairly short maybe 1 or max 2 subheadings here}
